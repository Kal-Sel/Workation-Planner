## Where to go on your next Workation  

A workation allows you to spend more time visiting faraway family members or really exploring a destination without having to drain all of your annual leave.  


## About the dataset
### *Methodology*
To compile the Workation Index, Holidu first collated a list of over 150 countries using ‘The world’s 100 best cities’ from bestcities.org and other various sources.

They then analysed each city on the below factors:

*Work*
Remote connection: Average WiFi mbps per second
Co-working spaces: Number of co-working spaces
Caffeine: Average price of buying a coffee
Travel: Average price of taxi per km2
After-work drinks: Average price for 2 beers in a bar

*Vacation*
Accommodation: Average price of 1 bedroom apartment per month
Food: Average cost of a meal at a local, mid-level restaurant
Climate: Average number of sunshine hours
Tourist attractions: Number of ‘Things to do’ on Tripadvisor
Instagramability: Number of photos with the #cityname
